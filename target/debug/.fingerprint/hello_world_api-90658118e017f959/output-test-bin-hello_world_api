{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"ambiguous associated type","code":{"code":"E0223","explanation":"An attempt was made to retrieve an associated type, but the type was ambiguous.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0223\ntrait Trait { type X; }\n\nfn main() {\n    let foo: Trait::X;\n}\n```\n\nThe problem here is that we're attempting to take the associated type of `X`\nfrom `Trait`. Unfortunately, the type of `X` is not defined, because it's only\nmade concrete in implementations of the trait. A working version of this code\nmight look like:\n\n```\ntrait Trait { type X; }\n\nstruct Struct;\nimpl Trait for Struct {\n    type X = u32;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let foo: <Struct as Trait>::X;\n}\n```\n\nThis syntax specifies that we want the associated type `X` from `Struct`'s\nimplementation of `Trait`.\n\nDue to internal limitations of the current compiler implementation we cannot\nsimply use `Struct::X`.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/server/trace_id.rs","byte_start":1455,"byte_end":1467,"line_start":47,"line_end":47,"column_start":47,"column_end":59,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> Self::Future {","highlight_start":47,"highlight_end":59}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"use fully-qualified syntax","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/server/trace_id.rs","byte_start":1455,"byte_end":1461,"line_start":47,"line_end":47,"column_start":47,"column_end":53,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> Self::Future {","highlight_start":47,"highlight_end":53}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"<TraceIdService<S> as Handler>::","suggestion_applicability":"MachineApplicable","expansion":null},{"file_name":"src/server/trace_id.rs","byte_start":1455,"byte_end":1461,"line_start":47,"line_end":47,"column_start":47,"column_end":53,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> Self::Future {","highlight_start":47,"highlight_end":53}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"<TraceIdService<S> as hyper::service::http::HttpService>::","suggestion_applicability":"MachineApplicable","expansion":null},{"file_name":"src/server/trace_id.rs","byte_start":1455,"byte_end":1461,"line_start":47,"line_end":47,"column_start":47,"column_end":53,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> Self::Future {","highlight_start":47,"highlight_end":53}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"<TraceIdService<S> as tower::make::make_connection::MakeConnection>::","suggestion_applicability":"MachineApplicable","expansion":null},{"file_name":"src/server/trace_id.rs","byte_start":1455,"byte_end":1461,"line_start":47,"line_end":47,"column_start":47,"column_end":53,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> Self::Future {","highlight_start":47,"highlight_end":53}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"<TraceIdService<S> as tower::make::make_service::MakeService>::","suggestion_applicability":"MachineApplicable","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0223]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: ambiguous associated type\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/server/trace_id.rs:47:47\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m     fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> Self::Future {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                               \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: use fully-qualified syntax\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[91m- \u001b[0m    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> \u001b[91mSelf::\u001b[0mFuture {\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ \u001b[0m    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> \u001b[92m<TraceIdService<S> as Handler>::\u001b[0mFuture {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[91m- \u001b[0m    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> \u001b[91mSelf::\u001b[0mFuture {\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ \u001b[0m    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> \u001b[92m<TraceIdService<S> as hyper::service::http::HttpService>::\u001b[0mFuture {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[91m- \u001b[0m    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> \u001b[91mSelf::\u001b[0mFuture {\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ \u001b[0m    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> \u001b[92m<TraceIdService<S> as tower::make::make_connection::MakeConnection>::\u001b[0mFuture {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[91m- \u001b[0m    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> \u001b[91mSelf::\u001b[0mFuture {\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m47\u001b[0m \u001b[92m+ \u001b[0m    fn call(&mut self, req: Request<Body>) -> \u001b[92m<TraceIdService<S> as tower::make::make_service::MakeService>::\u001b[0mFuture {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\n"}
